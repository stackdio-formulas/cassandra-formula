title: Cassandra 1.2.x Salt Formula
description: Salt formula for installing components of Cassandra 1.2.x. Please note
             that seed and regular nodes are the same exact thing, however, to make
             it easy for users to pick which hosts will be seeds we have separated
             them to easily find using the grain system in salt.
